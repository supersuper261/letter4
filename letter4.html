                     After thinking about what happened, I couldn't help but think about the possibilities that could have occurred. If I had talked to you about my problems, would everything have turned out differently? These thoughts have been bothering me and I wish I had been more honest and open about the difficulties I was going through. I realized that my main issue was not caused by outside factors or other individuals, but rather by myself. During difficult times, my thoughts became overwhelming and I ended up feeling trapped in a place where silence seemed like the only solace. And maybe you will only know this or maybe the others will that yeah my thoughts had gaining suicidal thoughts and at some point of a year I've try but. Regrettably, this silence issue also affected our relationship, and I sincerely apologize for that.
